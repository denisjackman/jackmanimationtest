June has continued where May left off.
The weather has not been great. Although work continues to be busy. 
I have managed to get a few things done. I will start with the fact that I had a city break in Barcelona.
We stayed for four (4) days in the [Hotel Rialto](https://www.hotel-rialto.com/EN/hotel.html) just off Las Ramblas. 
We went to the [Picasso museum](https://museupicassobcn.cat/index.php/en/museum/presentation), the [Sagrada Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia), 
a Flamenco Show ([Tablao Flamenco Cordobes](https://tablaocordobes.es/)) and did a bus tour around the city. The weather was great. The food was good. I recommend it highly to anyone. My main tip for the trip is to book any sightseeing 
tours you want to do. Failure to do so will result in disappointment. The Sagrada Familia is such an awesome sight. The idea of a project that cam be started and 
you will not see it completed is mind boggling. 

My exercise routine is still stalled and I am still looking for ways to bump myself out of this rut. I managed to read twelve (12) books this month. 
On the writing front I managed to write fifteen thousand and four hundred and three (15,403) words which is about five hundred and thirteen (513) words a day. 
This is above the target for the month and below the amount for the same time last year. This is also taking into account I had a few breaks when travelling for 
work and when I was in Barcelona. My coding habit has again been fairly regular and also interrupted by travel and work.

Other than that the month has been dominated by the preparations for the general election in early July and the European 2024 Championships. 
I have done quite a bot of travelling for work, with a trip to Leeds and Dublin. Roll on July and a change in government.
Please remember to vote. 
See you next month.
