2012-2013 Game So last night we had the first build session for the new participation game for MADGamers for 2012. The plan is to roll it out for Colours 2012 (8th and 9th September 2012, Newbury Berkshire). Some of you might be saying that we are leaving it late to prepare but actually it's not the case.  
  
The team had done a lot of work independently and last night we started to pull it together.  
  
We will be running a dice less game with monkeys in it. Why dice less? Because I wanted to see if it could be done. Why monkeys? Because last year at a show I was told that if our game had had monkeys in it we would have taken best game.  
  
The Avatars have been sourced from [Cubee](http://www.cubeecraft.com/). I had worried that they would be a bit flimsy for play but Russ Sandy (our master crafter) came up with an ingenious method to fix this. The Avatars have been built using Foamcard and the [Cubee](http://www.cubeecraft.com/) template.  
  
The Game board is multi level and Mark Foulds has done an excellent job in preparing that too.  
  
Enclosed are some pictures of us preparing the game.Yes we do have some work to do
